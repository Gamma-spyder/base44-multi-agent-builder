## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Product Vision:**  
A self-improving, web-based AI application builder that uses multi-agent orchestration to build full-stack SaaS applications through natural conversation. Users describe what they want, and specialized AI agents collaborate to generate production-ready, compliance-ready code that gets better over time.

**Key Differentiators:**  
Unlike single-agent builders, our orchestrator pattern with learning systems enables:

### Core Capabilities
- ✅ **Unlimited conversation length** - Agents hand off context seamlessly
- ✅ **Specialized expertise per domain** - Frontend, backend, database, security, testing, integration
- ✅ **Parallel task execution** - Multiple agents work simultaneously
- ✅ **Better code quality** - Each agent is a focused expert
- ✅ **Seamless handoffs** - Context flows automatically between agents

### Enterprise & SaaS Features  
- ✅ **Visual checklist of plan and feature roadmap** - Users can interact and choose what to work on next
- ✅ **Easily visualize database schema with ERD diagram view** - Interactive entity relationship diagrams
- ✅ **Purpose-built for building and maintaining SaaS products** - Specifically designed for non-technical founders and teams
- ✅ **Each project has its own building roadmap and PRD** - From the very beginning, AI orchestrator helps build full PRD with plan
- ✅ **Built-in security compliance for SOC 2 and ISO 27001** - Compliance-ready code generation

### Learning & Intelligence
- ✅ **Project-level memory database** - Agents learn and improve within each project context without rebuilding code every time
- ✅ **Platform-level learning system** - The SaaS product itself learns from all users and perpetually improves (anonymized learning)

**What This Means:**
- The platform gets **smarter every day**
- Each project **remembers its own patterns**
- Users benefit from **collective intelligence** (privacy-preserving)
- Built-in **enterprise compliance** from day one
- **Visual tools** for non-technical founders
